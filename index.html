      <h1>Real-Time 3D Game Programming</h1>

         <h2>Description</h2>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p>My biggest challenges in this project were understanding the SDL3/OpenGL syntax. Even with prior experience from CSCI 4611, implementing everything from scratch was still confusing at times. Some of the hardest features to implement were the camera, mouse-movement, and the (spotlight) flashlight. 
               Luckily, I was able to reference the <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Camera">OpenGL Camera Tutorial</a> for help implementing the camera and mouse feature.
               For the flashlight, I followed the <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Light-casters">OpenGL Lighting Tutorial</a>. However, I really struggle on this even though the tutorial only shows a few line of code. My main struggle with this feature was understanding the syntax for the fragment and vertex shader and how to pass variables. 
               That being said, debugging for this project took much longer than I expected. For example, I spent an absurd amount of time trying to figure out why my keys weren't rendering or why key pickup wasn't working. I thought it was a map-coordinate math issue, only to eventually discover that I was rendering the player before the map.
               Despite the challenges, the project was genuinely fun. I enjoyed building this little maze game and learning how to render 3D graphics without relying on ray tracing. It was a great hands-on way to deepen my understanding of real-time programming.
            </p>
            <p>Feel free to test out the game yourself! I also have to note that in my gifs below, I had to disable <code>SDL_SetWindowRelativeMouseMode</code> to screen record. It's also why I show my game being played in a top-down view because it was difficult to screen record and move my mouse when the cursor would leave the window.
               The actual game itself has the feature enabled, so the mouse movement is continuous and your cursor does not go out of the screen window.

               <p><strong>Additional Features I Implemented:</strong></p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Create a flashlight that moves with the player (must be a spot light)</li>
                  <li>Texture map the walls and floors (use different textures for different models)</li>
                  <li>Integrated keyboard and mouse control (must support strafing/sidestepping)</li>
                  <li>Make a video of yourself playing, showcasing your features (various gifs below show case this)</li>
